# Assembler Project

Welcome to my Assembler project repository!

This project was completed as part of the "Systems Programming Laboratory" course at the Open University of Israel. The Assembler is implemented in the C programming language and serves as an essential tool for translating assembly language code into machine language instructions. 

## Course Information

- **Course Title:** Systems Programming Laboratory
- **Course Page:** [Open University of Israel - Systems Programming Laboratory](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20465.htm)

## Project Overview

The Assembler project involved developing a robust tool capable of translating assembly language code into executable machine code. Leveraging the power of the C programming language, this project demonstrates advanced programming techniques and a deep understanding of system-level programming concepts.

## Features

- **Assembly Code Translation:** Translates assembly language instructions into machine code.
- **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling mechanisms to detect and report errors in the assembly code.
- **Optimization:** Implements optimizations to improve the efficiency and performance of the generated machine code.
- **Compatibility:** Ensures compatibility with various architectures and instruction sets.

## How to Use

To use the Assembler tool, simply [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository and follow the instructions provided in the documentation.
